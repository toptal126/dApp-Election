# dApp-Election

This is a client-side application that will talk to our smart contract on the blockchain. This client-side application will have a table of candidates that lists each candidate's id, name, and vote count. It will have a form where user can cast a vote for our desired candidate. It also shows the account 're connected to the blockchain with under "your account".
